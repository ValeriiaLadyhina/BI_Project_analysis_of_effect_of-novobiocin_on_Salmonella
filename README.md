# A Reproducible Workflow for project "Studying Salmonella gene expression dynamics in response to novobiocin" that was performed as a part of studies in [Bioinformatics institute](https://bioinf.me/en) during spring semester 2022.

## Intoduction

 In this project we analysed publicly available [transcriptomic data]('https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340920301918#sec1') 
 obtained in time series experiments on **_Salmonella enterica_ subsp. _enterica_ serovar Typhimurium str. 14028S** treated with different cobcentrations of antibiotic **novobiocin**DESeq2 and WGCNA analysis of time-series transcriptomic data
